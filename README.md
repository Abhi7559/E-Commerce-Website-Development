Project Title: E-Commerce Website Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Project Overview: I developed a fully responsive e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship at Tap Academy. The website provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing products, focusing on an intuitive shopping experience.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

No Backend (Static Site): The site is designed to work with minimal backend integration, showcasing client-side functionality.

Key Features:

Product Catalog: A clean, visually appealing display of products with categories, images, and descriptions for easy browsing.

Search & Filter: Built-in search and filtering functionality to help users find products based on categories, price ranges, or keywords.

Shopping Cart: Users can add items to the shopping cart with a simple, interactive experience built using JavaScript.

Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices using CSS media queries.

Product Details: Each product page contains detailed descriptions and images with the ability to toggle between various product variants (e.g., size, color).

Project Achievements:

Gained hands-on experience in developing a dynamic e-commerce user interface using only front-end technologies.

Enhanced skills in JavaScript to create a functional shopping cart and interactive product pages.

Focused on responsive design to ensure the website works smoothly across all device sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.

This project has further improved my front-end development skills, and I'm excited to continue working on more complex e-commerce solutions in the future!
